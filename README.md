#Welcome to my P10, Artsee!

Artsee is an app that allows you, as a user, to search the Brooklyn Museum's API for works of art. 

Let's find some art...

What does the search look like?

And what happens if the artist can not be found?

It's not as spectacular as I had anticipated, but considering it was built in three nights....

So, sign up, sign in, find an artist you like, and see some beautiful art.

And then come back, because soon there will also be a music player that will cross reference the date of the artworks you select and find the music that could have possibly inspired the artist while they were creating that work!
